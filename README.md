# Interview Session Adapter
#### From a given adapter type, apply it to PHP the core. 

This is an interview code excercise to deal with session adapters on PHP.

___

The main goal here is to create multiple adapters to apply on session handler, interacting to required adapter independently after validating it existance and it sanity.
**The real usage it's not required here** (eg: persist session data on DB/Redis, etc.) - the main goal is to write a real functional code.

### Usage goal:
```php
SessionHandler::register('files');
$_SESSION['foo'] = 'bar'; // should write on file
echo $_SESSION['foo']; // should return 'bar' from written file

// register weirdo adapter
SessionHandler::register('THIS_IS_A_DUMMY_ADAPTER'); // Exception thrown
```
